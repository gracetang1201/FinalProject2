# FinalProject2
What is our project?
Our project is an n-body simulator. We used physics to determine how celestial bodies would move if a given amount of them were in a close proximity to each other. We used processing to visualize how the planets would move. Created by Alex Lu and Grace Tang (The LuTang Clan).

Current Bugs: 

-- 6/5/17: Planets are not moving the right way.

-- 6/7/17: Planetary motion concept is done; just have to put together all the features.

-- 6/10/17: Planetary motion done.

-- 6/11/17: Central/initial planet not working properly

-- 6/11/17: The planets do not follow Kepler's laws

-- 6/11/17: Colors are not working properly

Features:

-- Click to add planet.

Dev Log:

-- 5/30/17: Basic Working Version

-- 6/2/17: Basic Working Version found to be faulty

-- 6/4/17: Basic Working Version scrapped, new basic version created, in a sleeker color

-- 6/6/17: Added code to make basic working version work for more than 2 bodies, somewhat functional

-- 6/7/17: Began progress on click to add body

-- 6/10/17: Adding planets, gravity working properly, not to scale

Disclaimer:

-- Take into account that distances between bodies are smaller than in the universe.
